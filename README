X-Plane XPLMDataAccess API Exposed as a RESTful Service.
==============================================

This plugin and service provide the ability to get and set x-plane variables via a RESTful service.

The plugin also eliminates the need to use the UDP interface, allowing the user to continue using a well known and documented interfaces via well-documented verbose string names, also known as data references or datarefs.
